# Commercial Risk Probability: Markov Inequalities and Convergence Insights

STAT2372 Probability Assignment (2022)

This assignment explored probability inequalities and convergence concepts with direct relevance to commercial risk assessment in finance and insurance. Key tasks included deriving improved tail probability bounds using Markov's inequality, proving consistency and convergence in probability/distribution, and verifying results through R simulations.

## Key Tasks
- Applied Markov's inequality to transformed variables for tighter risk bounds  
- Proved convergence properties with step-by-step mathematical derivations  
- Implemented R simulations (set.seed(2048)) to empirically demonstrate convergence behavior  

## Skills Demonstrated
- Probability theory for commercial risk bounds and stochastic processes  
- Mathematical derivations and analytical proofs  
- R programming for simulation, visualization, and result validation  
- Application to financial risk evaluation and business decision support
